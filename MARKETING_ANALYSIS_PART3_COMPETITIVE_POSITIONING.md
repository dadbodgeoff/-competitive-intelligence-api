## UNFAIR ADVANTAGES (What Competitors Can't Easily Copy)

### 1. **Speed Through AI Integration**
- **What:** Gemini 2.5 Flash + custom prompts = 30-60 sec parsing
- **Why it matters:** Competitors use manual entry or basic OCR
- **Moat:** Prompt engineering + post-processing = 95%+ accuracy
- **Time to copy:** 6-12 months (requires AI expertise + training data)

### 2. **Food Service Domain Expertise**
- **What:** Built by 10+ year restaurant owner who knows the pain
- **Why it matters:** Understands pack sizes, vendor formats, real workflows
- **Moat:** Competitors build for "all businesses" (generic)
- **Time to copy:** Hard (requires domain knowledge)

### 3. **Integrated Intelligence (5 Modules Working Together)**
- **What:** Invoice → Inventory → Menu → Pricing → Competitors
- **Why it matters:** Competitors offer 1-2 modules in isolation
- **Moat:** Data flows between modules (invoice prices → menu COGS → competitor comparison)
- **Time to copy:** 12-18 months (requires full platform rebuild)

### 4. **No Vendor Lock-in**
- **What:** Works with ANY vendor (not just partners)
- **Why it matters:** Competitors require vendor integrations
- **Moat:** AI parsing vs API integrations = flexibility
- **Time to copy:** Requires business model change (hard)

### 5. **Price Point ($29/mo)**
- **What:** 10x cheaper than enterprise tools
- **Why it matters:** Accessible to independent restaurants
- **Moat:** AI automation = low marginal cost
- **Time to copy:** Requires cost structure change (hard)
