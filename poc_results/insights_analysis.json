I also got Hawaiian pizza and ordered online it says bacon and pineapple but we instead got ham and pineapple. Also was super droopy and crust wasn\u2019t like it used to be. I used to love the crust here. It\u2019s just not the same for some reason today. Unfortunately I probably won\u2019t order here again because of this.

Clearly they\u2019re just mean people..They dont deserve the manager title. They could\u2019ve been like \u201cok but next time you have to leave it in the comments\u201d but instead they just told me no because I didn\u2019t put it in the comments\u2026 even tho every previous time I\u2019ve just called and they did it\u2026 Like I\u2019m sorry if she was having a bad day but taking it out on a customer is just not right. You could\u2019ve just put a side of ranch and gave me a good little tip that I could\u2019ve put it in the comments. I didn\u2019t even know there was a comment section.

The steak pizza was my favorite of the 4, and by far my new favorite pizza in all of New England.  They treat the crust as a functional and subtle commodity, spreading the toppings richly and equally across the entire pie leaving just about a half of in inch of crust to keep it all contained when handling.  Staff was helpful and engaging, pizzas were ordered through the website and they were hot and ready at the time scheduled.  Try this restaurant if you haven't already.  Try the steak pizza of you haven't done so as of yet.  5 stars of awesomeness awarded!!",
