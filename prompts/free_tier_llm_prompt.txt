# COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS - FREE TIER (STRATEGIC)

Analyze {{COMPETITOR_COUNT}} competitors for {{RESTAURANT_NAME}} ({{RESTAURANT_CATEGORY}} in {{RESTAURANT_LOCATION}}).

## STRATEGIC REVIEW DATA:
For each competitor, you have been given:
- 4 NEGATIVE reviews (1-2⭐) - representing common complaints and patterns
- 4 POSITIVE reviews (5⭐) - representing standout strengths and what customers love
- 2 NEUTRAL reviews (3-4⭐) - for balanced context

Reviews are sorted by quality and recency (newest, highest-quality first).

{{COMPETITOR_REVIEWS}}

## YOUR TASK:
Generate EXACTLY 2 insights per competitor ({{COMPETITOR_COUNT}} competitors = 4 total insights):

**For each competitor, provide:**
1. ONE WEAKNESS INSIGHT (from 1-2⭐ reviews)
   - Category: "opportunity" or "threat"
   - Identify the most common complaint or problem
   - Focus on: service issues, quality problems, wait times, order accuracy, cleanliness
   - Show how {{RESTAURANT_NAME}} can capitalize on this weakness

2. ONE STRENGTH INSIGHT (from 5⭐ reviews)
   - Category: "watch"
   - Identify what customers love most about this competitor
   - Focus on: signature items, service excellence, atmosphere, value, unique features
   - Show what {{RESTAURANT_NAME}} should monitor or counter

## PATTERN DETECTION:
- If 3+ reviews mention the same issue → HIGH confidence, HIGH significance (80-95)
- If 2 reviews mention the same issue → MEDIUM-HIGH confidence, significance (70-85)
- If only 1 review mentions issue → MEDIUM confidence, significance (50-70)
- **CRITICAL**: Look for patterns across the 4 negative and 4 positive reviews
- Prioritize recurring themes over one-off mentions
- Recent reviews carry more weight for significance scoring
