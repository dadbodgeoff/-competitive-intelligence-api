Shipped an AI-powered invoice processing system with real-time streaming 🚀

Key metrics from actual production run:
• Gemini 2.5 Flash: 64 seconds to parse PDF
• Extracted 15 line items with high confidence
• PostgreSQL save: 723ms (includes fuzzy matching)
• Cost per invoice: $0.0006
• Real-time SSE updates to frontend

Tech stack:
✅ FastAPI backend with async processing
✅ React + TypeScript frontend
✅ Gemini 2.5 Flash for document parsing
✅ PostgreSQL with fuzzy matching (Levenshtein)
✅ HTTPOnly cookies for security
✅ Server-Sent Events for real-time updates

The fuzzy matching automatically links invoice items to inventory using similarity algorithms - no manual mapping needed.

## 🎯 Reddit r/webdev Post

**Title:** Built an AI invoice processor with real-time streaming - Here are the actual metrics

**Post:**
```
Just finished building an invoice processing pipeline and wanted to share the real performance numbers.

**What it does:**
- Upload PDF invoice
- AI extracts line items, prices, quantities
- Fuzzy matches to existing inventory
- Saves to database with price tracking
- Real-time progress updates via SSE

**Actual metrics from production:**
- AI parsing: 64 seconds (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- Items extracted: 15 line items
- Database save: 723ms (includes fuzzy matching)
- Cost: $0.0006 per invoice
- Tokens used: 3,534

**Tech stack:**
- Backend: FastAPI (Python) with async
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- AI: Gemini 2.5 Flash
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Auth: HTTPOnly cookies
- Real-time: Server-Sent Events (SSE)

**Cool features:**
1. Fuzzy matching uses Levenshtein distance to automatically link invoice items to inventory
2. SSE streaming shows progress in real-time (not polling!)
3. HTTPOnly cookies for XSS protection
4. Malware scanning on upload
5. Transaction-based saves (all or nothing)

**Challenges:**
- Spent 8 hours debugging HTTPOnly cookie auth (worth it for security)
- Fuzzy matching needed tuning to avoid false positives
- SSE streaming required careful error handling

Diagram attached shows the flow with real timing data.

Happy to answer questions!

## 🎯 Key Talking Points

Use these to respond to comments:

**On Speed:**
"64 seconds might seem slow, but it's processing a full PDF, extracting structured data, validating prices, and matching to inventory. Traditional OCR + manual entry would take 10+ minutes."

**On Cost:**
"$0.0006 per invoice means processing 1,000 invoices costs $0.60. Compare that to manual data entry at $5-10 per invoice."

**On Fuzzy Matching:**
"The fuzzy matching uses Levenshtein distance to handle typos and variations. For example, 'FRST MRK CLEANER' matches to 'First Mark Cleaner' automatically."

**On Real-time Updates:**
"SSE (Server-Sent Events) is perfect for this - simpler than WebSockets, works over HTTP, and shows progress as the AI processes."

**On Security:**
"HTTPOnly cookies mean the auth token is inaccessible to JavaScript, protecting against XSS attacks. Took 8 hours to migrate but worth it."

## 🎯 What Makes This Flex-Worthy

✅ **Real metrics** (not just a diagram)
✅ **Modern tech** (Gemini 2.5, SSE, HTTPOnly)
✅ **Production-ready** (security, error handling)
✅ **Fast** (sub-second database saves)
✅ **Cheap** ($0.0006 per invoice)
✅ **Smart** (fuzzy matching, validation)

This isn't a tutorial project - this is production-grade software with real performance data. That's what makes it impressive.

Go flex! 💪
