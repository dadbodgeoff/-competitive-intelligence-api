## PROBLEM SECTION — Speak Their Pain

### Headline
**You're Running a Restaurant, Not a Data Center**

### The Reality
You already work 70 hours a week.

You don't have time to:
- Manually type 50-line invoices
- Call 3 vendors to compare beef prices
- Read 100 Yelp reviews to see what your neighbor does better
- Recalculate food costs every time chicken goes up $0.50/lb

### The Questions That Keep You Up
**But you *do* need to know:**
- Are you overpaying?
- Is your signature dish losing money?
- What are customers *actually* saying about the place across the street?

**That's where RestaurantIQ comes in.**

## FOUNDER STORY (Trust Building)

### Headline
**Built by an Owner, for Owners**

### Quote
"I ran restaurants for 10+ years and used every tool out there. They were all:
- Too slow (hours of data entry)
- Too expensive ($500+/month)
- Too complicated (weeks to learn)
- Built by people who never ran a restaurant

So I built RestaurantIQ: Fast. Cheap. Simple. Built by someone who actually knows the pain."

**— Geoffrey Fernald, Founder & Ex-Restaurant Owner**

## FAQ SECTION (Honest Answers)

### Q: Is this legal? Aren't you scraping reviews?
**A:** 100% legal. We use official APIs (Google Places, Outscraper) that comply with terms of service. No scraping, no gray area.

### Q: Will this work with my vendors?
**A:** Yes. Works with ANY vendor—Sysco, US Foods, local distributors, anyone. No integrations needed. Just upload invoices.

### Q: How accurate is the AI?
**A:** 95%+ accuracy on invoice parsing. We use Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google's latest) with custom prompts trained on food service invoices. Plus auto-correction for common errors.

### Q: What if I don't have time to learn new software?
**A:** Setup takes 5 minutes. Upload an invoice, click analyze. That's it. No training, no manual, no complexity.

### Q: Can I cancel anytime?
**A:** Yes. Cancel with one click. No contracts, no commitments. If it doesn't save you time in the first month, cancel.

### Q: What if my competitors aren't on Google?
**A:** If they have Google reviews, we can analyze them. Works for 99% of restaurants. If not, you can still use invoice/menu/pricing features.

### Q: Do you sell my data?
**A:** Never. Your data is yours. We don't sell, share, or use it for anything except your analysis. Period.

### Q: Will I really save money?
**A:** We can't guarantee specific savings—every restaurant is different. But you WILL know if you're overpaying, what your real costs are, and what competitors do better. What you do with that info is up to you.
