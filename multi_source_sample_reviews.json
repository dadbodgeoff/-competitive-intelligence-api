Today we ordered the Irish Benedict and the chicken and waffles both dishes were phenomenal!! Our server was so friendly and attentive. She even had the kitchen divide each order in to 2 plates so we were able to sample. That was such a great idea.",

No strawberries inside but they gave me a freezing cold size of strawberries in juice (not sweetened). This was $15. My husbands bacon also looked shredded and fatty. I wanted regular breakfast with beans but saw that a side of beans is $6.29! You can make a 5 quart pot for that price.",
