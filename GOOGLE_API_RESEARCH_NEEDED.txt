RESEARCH NEEDED: Google Places API Review Limits
================================================================================

QUESTION: Can Google Places API return more than 5 reviews?

WHAT WE TESTED:
1. Place Details API - Got 5 reviews
2. New Places API (v1) - Got 5 reviews

WHAT TO RESEARCH:
1. Check Google's official documentation for review limits
2. Look for any pagination parameters we missed
3. Check if there's a "reviews" specific endpoint
4. See if there are undocumented parameters
5. Check Stack Overflow for workarounds

SOURCES TO CHECK:
- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details
- https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-reviews
- Stack Overflow: "google places api more than 5 reviews"
- Reddit: r/webdev discussions
- GitHub issues on googlemaps Python library

ALTERNATIVE APIS TO RESEARCH:
- Google My Business API (might have more access)
- Google Maps JavaScript API (might have different limits)
- Yelp Fusion API (alternative source)

ACTION ITEMS:
1. User should verify via Google's official docs
2. Check if there's a business/premium tier with higher limits
3. Explore if combining multiple APIs gives more reviews
4. Consider if the limitation is acceptable for MVP

RECOMMENDATION:
Since I cannot browse the internet, the user should:
1. Google: "google places api review limit 2024"
2. Check official Google documentation
3. Look for recent Stack Overflow answers
4. See if anyone has found a workaround

If the limit is truly 5 reviews, we should pivot to making the ANALYSIS better rather than getting more reviews.
