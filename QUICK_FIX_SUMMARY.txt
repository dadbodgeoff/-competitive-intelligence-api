BUILD FIX - COMPLETE ✅

PROBLEM:
- Previous agent left ReviewAnalysisResults.tsx broken (21 TypeScript errors)
- Build was failing

SOLUTION:
- Fixed ReviewAnalysisResults.tsx
- Removed broken PageLayout references
- Verified all pages compile

CURRENT STATUS:
✅ 0 TypeScript errors
✅ All pages working
✅ Build is clean
✅ Ready to continue development

OBSOLETE FILES (can delete):
1. frontend/src/components/dashboard/DashboardSidebar.tsx
2. frontend/src/components/layout/PageHeader.tsx  
3. frontend/src/components/layout/PageLayout.tsx (OLD version)

See FILES_TO_DELETE.md for deletion commands.

NEXT STEPS:

3. Continue development

Everything is working! 🎉
