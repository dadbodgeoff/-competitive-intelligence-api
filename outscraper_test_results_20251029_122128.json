I\u2019ve found my new favorite when I was visiting a friend up in Woonsocket. Friendly service, friendly customers, but best of all- the food. Got the lasagna pizza to take home for dinner tonight with the kids. The crust is so chewy and good. The toppings delicious. Also had a great gyro from there for lunch for my long drive home.  Just wished it had more of the yogurt sauce so when I come again will ask for extra.",

I asked if they made chicken florentine pizza, at that point they stated they wished they had space on the menu.\n\nThe owner then comes out and says next time in I\u2019ll make one for you just let me know. I then ordered a Hawaiian pizza and a classic pepperoni.\n\nFast forward 15 mins the gentlemen brings the pizza to my car door, but there is 3 pizzas? As I look puzzled the worker says the owner made  you the pizza you asked for  chicken florentine.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m confused , and ask how much I owe you now, the reply was nothing !!!!\n\nI\u2019ve never had another pizza shop have that act of kindness just to make someone\u2019s day better.\n\nFunny thing was I went to like 5 pizza shops and asked if they make it and everyone of them said no and let me walk out the door.  All I can say is thank you all star pizza!!!!",

The crust is perfectly cooked\u2014crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. The staff is friendly, attentive, and makes you feel welcome every time.

Service used to be friendly, cheerful, now ya barely get a smile from these waitresses.  Had to ask for splenda three times before it finally arrived. And the steak in the steak omelet reminded me of those steakum type things from the freezer section.  Definitely not worth the $20+ that that build your own omelet ended up costing.  Oh, and the prices have gone up drastically too.",
