SQUARE 1:1 PHOTOGRAPH — The ultimate Christmas morning indulgence. A pancake stack so perfect it belongs on a holiday card.

THE HERO: A magnificent stack of 4-5 fluffy buttermilk pancakes, golden brown with slightly crispy edges. The stack is GENEROUS—these are diner-style pancakes, not precious little silver dollars. Each pancake shows the telltale bubbles of perfect griddle technique.

THE TOPPINGS (this is where the magic happens):
- A generous pat of butter on top, ACTIVELY MELTING, rivulets running down the sides
- Real maple syrup being poured from a classic diner-style pitcher—capture the pour mid-action, the amber syrup glistening
- A dusting of powdered sugar like fresh snow
- Fresh strawberries and blueberries cascading down one side (red and blue = festive!)
- A dollop of fresh whipped cream on top, maybe with a mint leaf

THE PLATE & SETTING:
- Classic white diner plate or vintage holiday-themed plate
- The table: Could be a worn formica counter, a cozy booth table, or a home kitchen table with holiday tablecloth
- Surrounding elements: A steaming cup of coffee in a classic diner mug, a small glass of orange juice, crispy bacon strips on a side plate
- Holiday touches: A small wrapped gift in the corner, a sprig of holly, a candy cane, Christmas lights bokeh in background

THE ATMOSPHERE:
- Lighting: Warm morning light streaming through a window, creating beautiful highlights on the syrup and butter. The golden hour of breakfast.
- Background: Soft focus suggesting a cozy diner interior or home kitchen. Maybe a glimpse of a Christmas tree or holiday decorations.
- The feeling: Christmas morning MAGIC. The reward for being good all year.
