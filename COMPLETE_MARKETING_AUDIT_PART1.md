## PART 1: PRODUCT INTELLIGENCE

### 1.1 Core Problem Solved

**The Pain:** "I'm Flying Blind"

Restaurant owners face:
- Don't know if vendors are overcharging
- Don't know real food costs on menu items  
- Don't know what competitors are doing better
- Spend hours on manual data entry instead of running restaurant

**Emotional Impact:**
- Stress: "Am I losing money?"
- Frustration: "Why is this so hard?"
- Fear: "What if I'm missing something?"

**The Solution:**
One platform that automates:
1. Invoice processing (30 sec vs 25 min)
2. Price tracking across vendors
3. Menu cost calculation (COGS)
4. Competitor intelligence (150 reviews in 2.5 min)
5. Inventory management with fuzzy matching

**Transformation:**
From "I have no idea what's going on" → "I know exactly where I stand and what to do"
