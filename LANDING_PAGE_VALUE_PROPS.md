## Visual Ideas to Make It Pop:

1. **Before/After Split Screen**
   - Left: Stressed manager buried in papers
   - Right: Same manager on phone, smiling, with customers

2. **Animated Counter**
   - "You've saved [17] hours this week"
   - "That's [$XXX] in labor costs"
   - "Or [2.1] full workdays"

3. **Interactive Calculator**
   - "How many invoices do you process per week?"
   - Shows their personal time savings

4. **Video Testimonial**

## The Psychology:

**Time savings** = Good, but abstract
**Freedom/outcomes** = Better, more emotional
**Specific pain points** = Best, most relatable

People don't buy time. They buy what they can DO with that time.
